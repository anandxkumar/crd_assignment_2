# Custom Resource Definition Assignment


## Resource Creation 

- For starting minikube `$ minikube start --driver podman`
- Resource `Type = Kluster, Group = ak.dev, version = v1aplha1`
- Create resource file `Kluster.yaml` with Spec details
- Added resource definition by `$ kubectl apply -f crd.yaml`
- Creating an object of CRD by declaring `object.yaml`
- Added crd based object by `$ kubectl apply -f object.yaml`
- Checking if object is running by `$ kubeclt get Kluster` or `$ kubectl get -o wide` for more details:
```
NAME        AGE
kluster-0   51m
```
- `kubectl api-resources | grep Kluster`
```
klusters                          kl           ak.dev/v1alpha1                        true         Kluster
```
- To check API endpoint `$ kubectl proxy --port=8010`
- In new terminal `$ curl localhost:8010/apis | grep ak.dev/v1alpha1`
```

- `$ curl localhost:8010/apis/ak.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/klusters` for checking object

## Controller Creation

- go to `$ cd home/{user}/go/src/github.com/{github_username}`
- Create folder `kluster/pkg/api/{Group}/{version}`, add `types.go`
- Add definitions of cluster type and its fields in the `types.go` file
- We need to specifiy that the Kluster Spec is a Kubernetes object, for this we will create a `register.go` file in the same directory that will register the Kluster type to scheme.
- `register.go` code can be generated using `https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator`.
- Create `doc.go` for declaring tabs. `tabs` are basically used to call a particular instruction for all valid instance over the codebase. For eg- `+k8s:deepcopy-gen=package` means that a deep copy must be generated at every package. This is global. If we declare it anywhere else, it will be local. 
- Install `code-generator` by `$ go get k8s.io/code-generator` (Path: `Home/go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/code-generator@v0.26.2`)
- Create alias path `$ execDir=~/go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/code-generator@v0.26.2`
- Create deepcopy, lister, clientset and informers by runnning `$ "${execDir}"/generate-groups.sh all github.com/anandxkumar/crd_assignment_2/pkg/client github.com/anandxkumar/crd_assignment_2/pkg/apis run.com:v1alpha1 --go-header-file "${execDir}"/hack/boilerplate.go.txt`
- Now the deepcopy, clientset, Informers and listeners would have been added to the local directory.
- Create the `main.go`. In `main.go` we will declare the `kubeconfig`, create `clientsets` and the gnerate clusters.
- To add all dependency : `$ go mod tidy`, then build using `$ go build` 
- To create CRD, you can create it manually or can use `controller-gen` command i.e. `$ go install sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/kustomize@latest` and  `$ controller-gen paths=github.com/anandxkumar/kluster/pkg/apis/ak.dev/v1alpha1  crd:trivialVersions=true rbac:roleName=controller-perms output:crd:artifacts:config=config/crd/bases`
- To run main.go `$ ./kluster`


- To Fix `client/listers/kluster.go `resource error, go create a function in `pkg/apis/ak.dev/v1alpha1/register.go `
```
func Resource(resource string) schema.GroupResource {
	return SchemeGroupVersion.WithResource(resource).GroupResource()
}
```

## Running Controller

- `$ go build && ./kluster` or `$ go run main.go`
- In home directory there is a `object.yaml`, it will create, update or delete the Custom Resource of the CRD we created.
Following are the things we can do with the object:
- If we want to create a new object, we can specify the name of CR and count of the number of pods of the CR and run `$ kubectl create -f objects.yaml`. That number of pods will get running up for that CR.
- If we want to update the number of pods or message, just make the changes in the `objects.yaml` file and then run `$ kubectl apply -f objects.yaml`. Depending on the current running pods and the desired pods, the required number of pods will get created or deleted accordingly. To check pods `$ kubectl get pods` and to check content of pods `$ kubectl describe kluster` 

For deleting a CR
- `$ kubectl delete -f object.yml`, this will make sure all the associated pods are deleted as well.

For deleting a pod
- `$ kubectl delete pod {podname}`
After deleting the pod, they won't spawn back
